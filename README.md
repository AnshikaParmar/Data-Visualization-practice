## 📁 File Included

- `Data_Visualization.ipynb`: The main notebook with all code, charts, and analysis.

---

## 🧰 Libraries Used

- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and cleaning  
- **NumPy** – for numerical calculations  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – for static data visualizations  
- **Plotly Express** – for interactive visualizations  
- **Statsmodels** – for time series decomposition  
- **WordCloud**, **TextBlob/NLTK** – for text and sentiment analysis (if applicable)
